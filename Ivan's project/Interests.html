		<h3>Sports</h3>
		<p>
		Although I am no longer able to play sports I still have a big interest in them. Up until I<br>
		was 16 years old I was a heavily involved in Gaelic Football and Camogie. I played Gaelic with both my<br>
		school and my local club. Most of the time I played full-forward but now and again i was put in midfield.<br>
		For camogie I played as a centre-back. Unfortunately during a Gaelic match I tore my Acl which put an end<br>
		to both sports. Now I am a member of NRG Fitness Gym in Little Island and train there regularly. The gym<br>
		is a huge part of my life now, during the Leaving Cert it gave me a well needed break from studying<br>
		and stressing over exams, I found it the best way to get a break from the books. Now I go to the <br>
		gym after college up to 5 times a week. I find sports and exercise very important, not only for health<br>
		reasons but also for mental reasons. Exercise is the best way to relieve stress and relax in my opinion.<br>
		<br>

		<h3>Travel</h3>
		<p>
		Travelling has been a big interest of mine ever since I was young. Travelling has given me the opportunity to<br>
		see and experience a variety of different cultures. When I was two years old my parents took me to Alicante in Spain<br>
		and I have been going there ever since. My family owns a villa in Alicante which gives me the opportunity to go there<br>
		when I please. This has also given me the chance to learn Spanish and I now consider myself to have a very good<br>
		understanding of the language. Another place I had the opportunity to visit was Liverpool. In January, myself and a<br>
		friend took a trip there. We got the chance to explore Anfield Stadium, see the Radio City Tower and of course <br>
		experience the night-life. In the near future I hope to visit America, either on a J1 or on placement. In my opinion I think<br>
		everyone who has the opportuinty to travel should act on it, especially at my age. Young people should travel and explore the<br>
		world before settling down and working full-time. I myself am hoping to go travelling this summer with my friends.<br>
