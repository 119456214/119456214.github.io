		<p>Hyperautomation brings together several components of process automation, integrating tools <br>
		 and technologies that amplify the ability to automate work. It starts with robotic process <br>
		 automation (RPA) at its core, and expands automation capability with artificial intelligence (AI), <br>
		 process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools. The idea is to automate more and more knowledge <br>
		 work, and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation.

		<p>Multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective<br>
		 experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a <br>
		 consistent experience from a business perspective. Multiexperience design looks to cater to the unique experience<br>
		 of each device, stream or channel, rather than just bluntly adapting or porting over. It seeks to provide a smooth<br>
		 experience on any channel or device. It focuses on creating solutions that seamlessly adapt from smartphone or laptop<br>
		 to wearables, or even audio-controlled devices

		<p> Distributed Cloud Computing generalizes the cloud computing model to position, process, and serve data and applications<br>
		from geographically distributed sites to meet requirements for performance, redundancy and regulations. distributed computing<br>
		spreads computation workload across multiple, interconnected servers, distributed cloud computing generalizes this to the cloud<br>
		infrastructure itself. A distributed cloud is an execution environment where application components are placed at appropriate<br>
		geographically-dispersed locations chosen to meet the requirements of the application.
